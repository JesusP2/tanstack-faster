# Tanstack-Faster
A straight-up clone of [NextFaster](https://next-faster.vercel.app/) but adapted to [Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest).
I obviously took a lot of inspiration from their project(by this I mean I literally copied the UI and postgres queries), so shoutout to team and please check them out [nextfaster source code](https://github.com/ethanniser/NextFaster).

This project uses postgres, redis and a sharp server for image optimization. Everything was deployed in railway.
